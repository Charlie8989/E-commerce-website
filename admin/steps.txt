we created admin panel and linked it to backendurl using axios and got the response
when i am clicking login then geting redirected to admin panel because i have added on submit handler function
when we r refreshing then we get automatically logged out to avoid this we used localstorage by which we store token in localstorage and after we use
on uploading we are not seeing the image we r seeing the iload area so we use the URL.createobjecturl function which will create url and disply the image if present
we used authi=orization while adding product const response = await axios.post(
        backendURL + "/api/product/add",
        formData,
        { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
      );
